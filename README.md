<p align="justify">This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables. <p>

- Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

- Approx 2.34 million rides for the month of August, 2019.
- From which 1.9 million users were subscribers and 0.44 million users were customer.
- 1.5 million were male riders, 0.59 million were female and 0.22 were unknown. 
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic areas in Manhattan.

</p>  
	
- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- Maintenance hours are 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM because of slow time of riding. 

### Checkout times for users

</p>  

- Most checkout time is from 4 to 6 hours.
	
### Checkout times by gender

- Here showing that Male users take long time than the female users.
	
### Trips by weekday and gender

- Most weekday rides are around 7 to 9 and 5 to 7.
- And also weekend rides are pick from 10 to 7.

## Summary:
<p align="justify"> From this project analysis of activity of the bike sharing in NYC during the month of August 2019 is pick. and most of the rides remain active in Manhattan Island. So, the conclusion of the project is that as a alternative of transportation for cummuting workers Bike service is mostly preferable one. <p>
