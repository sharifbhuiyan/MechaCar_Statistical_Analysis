<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src=https://github.com/sharifbhuiyan/bikesharing/blob/main/images/peak_month.png
</p>  
	
- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- Maintenance hours are 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM because of slow time of riding. 

### Checkout times for users
	
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src=https://github.com/sharifbhuiyan/bikesharing/blob/main/images/checkout_users.png
</p>  

- Most checkout time is from 4 to 6 hours.
	
### Checkout times by gender

- Here showing that Male users take long time than the female users.
	
### Trips by weekday and gender
	
<p align="center">

</p>
	
- Most weekday rides are around 7 to 9 and 5 to 7.
- And also weekend rides are pick from 10 to 7.
	
## Summary:
<p align="justify"> From this project analysis of activity of the bike sharing in NYC during the month of August 2019 is pick. and most of the rides remain active in Manhattan Island. So, the conclusion of the project is that as a alternative of transportation for cummuting workers Bike service is mostly preferable one. <p>
